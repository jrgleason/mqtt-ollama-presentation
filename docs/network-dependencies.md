## Required Network Dependencies

### 1. Auth0 Authentication Service ☁️

**Service:** Auth0 (auth0.com)
**Network Type:** Internet (external cloud service)
**Used By:**
- `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` SDK
- `src/lib/auth0.ts`
- `src/middleware.ts`

**Rationale:**
- Auth0 is a cloud-based authentication service
- Provides secure, industry-standard OAuth2/OIDC authentication
- Universal Login page hosted by Auth0
- Token validation and session management

**Network Calls:**
- **Outbound to Auth0:**
  - User login redirects to `https://{AUTH0_DOMAIN}/authorize`
  - Token exchange at `https://{AUTH0_DOMAIN}/oauth/token`
  - User info retrieval at `https://{AUTH0_DOMAIN}/userinfo`
  - JWKS (public keys) at `https://{AUTH0_DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`
  - Logout at `https://{AUTH0_DOMAIN}/v2/logout`

**Mitigation for Offline Scenarios:**
- Could implement mock auth provider for local development
- Session cookies persist, reducing frequent auth calls
- JWKS keys are cached

**Demo Impact:**
- **Internet required at demo venue**
- Backup: Pre-authenticated session cookies (if demo WiFi fails)
- Can explain this is a design choice for secure authentication

### 2. Ollama Model Downloads 🔽

**Service:** Ollama model registry (ollama.com)
**Network Type:** Internet (one-time download)
**Used By:**
- Initial setup: `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`

**Rationale:**
- Models must be downloaded once before use
- Downloads large files (1-3GB per model)

**Network Calls:**
- **Outbound to Ollama:**
  - Model download at `https://ollama.com/library/{model}`
  - Manifest and layer downloads

**Mitigation for Offline Scenarios:**
- **Models are cached locally after first download**
- Pre-download models before demo
- Models stored in `/usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models/` (Linux) or `~/.ollama/models/` (Mac)

**Demo Impact:**

- Pre-setup: Download models on demo hardware before event

---

### 3. NPM Package Installation 📦

**Service:** npm registry (npmjs.org)
**Network Type:** Internet (one-time installation)
**Used By:**
- Development: `npm install` / `pnpm install`

**Rationale:**
- JavaScript dependencies must be fetched from npm
- Standard practice for Node.js projects

**Network Calls:**
- **Outbound to npm:**
  - Package downloads at `https://registry.npmjs.org/`
  - Package metadata retrieval

**Mitigation for Offline Scenarios:**
- **Dependencies installed once, then cached in `node_modules/`**
- Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) ensure reproducible builds
- Could use offline npm mirror if needed

**Demo Impact:**
- **No internet needed during demo** (after `npm install` is run)

- whisper.cpp model download

**Rationale:**
- Whisper base model (~74MB) must be downloaded for speech-to-text
- Model enables local voice transcription without cloud dependencies
- Part of Phase 5: Voice Integration (stretch goal)

**Network Calls:**
- **Outbound to Hugging Face:**
  - Model download at `https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.bin`
  - Size: 74MB

**Mitigation for Offline Scenarios:**
- **Model cached locally after first download**
- Pre-download model before demo: `npm run setup` in voice-gateway
- Model stored in `voice-gateway/models/ggml-base.bin`
- Docker build can download model at image build time

**Demo Impact:**
- **No internet needed during demo** (after model is downloaded)
- Pre-setup: Run `npm run setup` in voice-gateway before event
- Estimated download time: 30-60 seconds on decent connection

---

### 3.2 Porcupine Wake Word Model 🔽

**Service:** Picovoice Porcupine SDK
**Network Type:** Internet (one-time, embedded in SDK)
**Used By:**
- voice-gateway: `@picovoice/porcupine-node` package

**Rationale:**
- Wake word detection models embedded in npm package
- "Computer" wake word included in SDK (~5MB)
- Requires Picovoice API key (free tier) for runtime

**Network Calls:**
- **npm package install** - Wake word models bundled in `@picovoice/porcupine-node`
- **Runtime:** Porcupine API key validation (online check during initialization)
  - **Mitigation:** API key validated once at startup, then works offline

**Mitigation for Offline Scenarios:**
- Wake word models installed with npm package (no separate download)
- API key validated at voice-gateway startup
- Once validated, voice-gateway runs fully offline
- **Recommendation:** Start voice-gateway before demo to validate API key

**Demo Impact:**
- **No internet needed during demo** (after initial startup)
- Pre-setup:
  1. Sign up for free Picovoice account: https://console.picovoice.ai
  2. Generate Access Key
  3. Add to voice-gateway `.env`: `PORCUPINE_ACCESS_KEY=your_key_here`
  4. Start voice-gateway once with internet to validate key
  5. Demo can run offline after validation

## Demo Environment Network Requirements

### Minimum Network Setup for Live Demo

**Option A: Full Internet Access (Recommended)**
- ✅ Auth0 authentication works normally
- ✅ Can show full authentication flow
- ✅ Most reliable for audience

**Option B: Local Network Only (Backup)**
- ⚠️ Auth0 will fail without internet
- ✅ MQTT, Ollama, Z-Wave still work
- ✅ Could use pre-authenticated session or mock auth
- 📝 Must explain Auth0 requires internet

**Option C: Fully Offline (Emergency)**
- ❌ Auth0 authentication disabled
- ✅ All local services work (MQTT, Ollama, Z-Wave)
- ✅ Remove auth middleware temporarily
- 📝 Must explain this is demo-only configuration

## Design Philosophy

### Cloud-Free Where Possible 🛡️

The project prioritizes **local-first architecture**:
- ✅ All AI processing happens locally (Ollama)
- ✅ All device control is local (MQTT + Z-Wave)
- ✅ No telemetry or data sent to cloud
- ⚠️ Only Auth0 requires cloud (security best practice)

### Why Auth0 Cloud vs Local Auth?

**Reasons for cloud-based Auth0:**
1. **Security best practices** - OAuth2/OIDC standard
2. **Industry-standard solution** - Demonstrate production-ready approach
3. **Ease of implementation** - Official Next.js SDK
4. **Social login support** - Could add Google/GitHub login
5. **Audit logging** - Auth attempts tracked by Auth0

**Trade-off accepted:**
- Authentication is the **only** cloud dependency during demo
- Could swap for local auth (e.g., NextAuth.js, Keycloak) in production
- For home automation, local auth might be preferred
- Demo prioritizes showing proper auth patterns

## Testing Network Dependencies

### Pre-Demo Checklist

1. **Internet connectivity test:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://YOUR_DOMAIN.auth0.com
   # Should return 200 OK
   ```

2. **Ollama models cached:**
   ```bash
   ollama list
   # Should show qwen2.5:3b or gemma2:2b
   ```

3. **npm packages installed:**
   ```bash
   cd oracle && npm list --depth=0
   # Should show all dependencies
   ```

4. **Docker images pulled:**
   ```bash
   docker images | grep -E "mosquitto|zwave-js-ui"
   # Should show images with sizes
   ```

5. **Local MQTT broker reachable:**
   ```bash
   curl -v mqtt://localhost:1883
   # Or use MQTT client to test connection
   ```

6. **Local Ollama reachable:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   # Should return JSON with model list
   ```

## Backup Plans for Network Failures

### If Demo Venue WiFi Fails

**Priority 1: Use Phone Hotspot**
- Enable mobile hotspot on phone
- Connect demo laptop to hotspot
- Auth0 will work over cellular

**Priority 2: Skip Authentication**
- Temporarily disable auth middleware
- Hard-code a demo user session
- Show code and explain this is demo-only
- All other features (MQTT, Ollama, Z-Wave) still work

**Priority 3: Show Pre-Recorded Video**
- Backup video in `presentation/backup-demo.mp4`
- Explain the code while video plays
- Walk through architecture diagrams

---

## Future Improvements

**Reduce Network Dependencies:**
1. **Optional local auth** - Implement NextAuth.js as alternative to Auth0
2. **Offline model serving** - Pre-bundle Ollama models in Docker image
3. **Vendored npm packages** - Bundle dependencies in repo (not recommended)

**Enhance Local-First:**
1. **Local LLM** ✅ Already implemented (Ollama)
2. **Local MQTT** ✅ Already implemented (Mosquitto)
3. **Local Z-Wave** ✅ Already implemented (USB stick)
4. **Local voice** 🎯 Whisper.cpp (stretch goal)

## Voice Gateway Network Requirements (Phase 5)

**New in v2.0:** Voice integration adds two new network dependencies for initial setup:

1. **Whisper Model** - 74MB one-time download
2. **Porcupine API Key** - Free tier registration + validation at startup

**Key Point:** Both are one-time setup requirements. Once models are downloaded and API key validated, voice-gateway runs fully offline during demo.

**Pre-Demo Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Sign up for Picovoice account
open https://console.picovoice.ai

# 2. Add API key to .env
echo "PORCUPINE_ACCESS_KEY=your_key_here" >> voice-gateway/.env

# 3. Download models
cd voice-gateway && npm run setup

# 4. Validate API key (requires internet once)
npm start
# Wait for "Wake word detection started" message
# Ctrl+C to stop

# 5. Demo ready (no internet needed)
```
