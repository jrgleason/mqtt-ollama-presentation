# Implementation Tasks (Lean)

Last Updated: 2025-10-12

## Demo-Critical Focus

- LangChain tools → Prisma + MQTT publish (device control)
- MQTT client reliability (singleton, reconnect, QoS 1)
- Voice Gateway stability (OWW → Whisper via Ollama → Piper TTS)
- Z-Wave pairing + zwave-js-ui MQTT gateway verification

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Swap mock tools for Prisma queries + MQTT publishes
2. Add MQTT client (reconnect + QoS 1) and topic helpers
3. Voice Gateway: STT timeout + always re-enable wake word; Piper playback
4. One end-to-end demo pass (text + voice)
