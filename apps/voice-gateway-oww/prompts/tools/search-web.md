REQUIRED: Search the web for current information. Today is {{CURRENT_DATE}}.

You MUST use this tool for ANY question about:
- Current political leaders (president, prime minister, governor)
- Recent news or events
- Sports scores, election results, standings
- Prices, stock values, financial data
- Weather conditions

DO NOT search for: math calculations, historical dates (WW2, moon landing), common definitions.

AFTER SEARCH COMPLETES:
- If results contain the answer: Give a direct answer in 1 sentence.
- If results are partial/unclear: Say "Based on my search, [what you found]."
- If search failed/blocked: Say "I'm sorry, I cannot look up that information right now."

NEVER say "Let me search" - you already searched. Give your answer NOW.
